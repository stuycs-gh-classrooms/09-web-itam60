<h1>What is crochet?</h1>
<p>
  Crochet is another method of creating fabric from fiber that has been practiced in its modern form <a href="https://littlejohnsyarn.com/who-invented-crochet-the-interesting-history-of-crochet/">since the 15th century</a>. It involves one crochet hook, which is a thin rod that ends in a small hooked head. The fiber is used to create a single loop around the shaft of the hook instead of a row of loops, and the head is used to pull fiber through the loop, forming a chain. The hook is then used to pull fiber through the links of the chain, creating a piece of fabric. There are many different stitches, such as the single crochet, double crochet, treble crochet, and popcorn stitch. Generally, stitches increase in height by "yarning over" (wrapping the yarn around the hook before finishing the stitch) one or more times. While the finished fabric is generally somewhat dense with a rough texture due to the stitches protruding, it can vary depending on the hook size and yarn weight used. For example, a size H hook with lace weight yarn will create a light, thin fabric with large gaps between the stitches but a size E hook with worsted weight yarn will create a thicker, less flexible fabric with barely any gaps between the stitches. Lastly, the number of stitches in a row can be increased by working into the same stitch twice or decreased by working into 2 stitches at once.
