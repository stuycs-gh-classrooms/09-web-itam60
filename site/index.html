  Knitting and crochet may seem practically identical to the unfamiliar, but they are in fact different in both technique and finished product. While I tend to prefer knitting, both have their place depending on what I want to make. When doing either in public, people have expressed confusion over the difference and advantages of either craft. This site is about the similarities and differences of each method in technique, desired product, materials required, and speed of production.
