<h1>What is knitting?</h1>
<p>
  Knitting is a method of creating fabric from fiber that has been practiced <a href="https://www.the-sustainable-fashion-collective.com/2017/05/04/knitting-brief-history-knitting-uses">for more than a millenium</a>. It involves 2 straight, pointed knitting needles. The fiber is wrapped around 1 needle, creating a row of loops, and the second needle is used to pull the fiber through each loop. The loops are essentially transferred from needle to needle, and the fabric grows longer with each row. There are only 2 basic stitches, which are the knit and purl. Any more complicated stitches are only combinations of these 2. When knitting, the row of stitches or loops is transferred between needles 1 at a time from the left needle to the right. "Cables" are made by slipping several stitches onto a placeholder needle, knitting several stitches, then knitting the stitches off of the placeholder needle, forming a section of stitches crossed over each other.
