<h1>Knitting vs. Crochet: which is better?</h1>
<p>
  Crochet and knitting create <a href="https://sarahmaker.com/knitting-vs-crochet/">very different pieces of fabric</a>. When using the same worsted weight yarn, knit fabric is more similar to mass-produced fabric: it is thin, stretchy, flat, and flexible. Meanwhile, crochet fabric made with that yarn is thick, less flexible, and bumpy, with larger gaps between the stitches. This makes knitting a better method for making larger garments like sweaters, while crochet is better for small items like amigurumi (small stuffed toys). However, there is significant overlap between these categories: for example, both methods can be used to make hats and scarves.

  Both crafts can also be worked in the round, meaning stitches are formed around a spiral instead of back and forth in flat rows. This makes creating hats, gloves, and stuffed animals much easier and allows other garments such as sweaters to be made without seams.
