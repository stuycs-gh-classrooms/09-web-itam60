    <h2>What is Stuyvesant Roadrunners?</h2>
    <p>
        Roadrunners is a low-commitment, non-competitive running club that serves to improve members' physical health and create a supportive community for running regardless of skill level. Anyone is welcome, from people who have no experience at running but would like to try to year-round track stars! Fun fact: this club is also Stuyvesant's oldest non-PSAL sports club and is a branch of the <a href="https://www.nyrr.org/">NYRR association</a>, which was founded in 1958 and now has over 60,000 members.
    </p>
    <h2>What to expect from meetings?</h2>
    <p>
        We meet Monday, Wednesday, and Friday during 10th period *and* after school, so if you have 10th period free, you can go for a run and still leave at a normal time. We usually run 1 mile along the Hudson River but sometimes run 2 depending on member and leader input. Afterwards, we return to the school building to do stretches and core exercises. On rainy or extremely cold (below 20 degrees Fahrenheit) days, we may do alternate indoors activities such as running up and down Stuyvesant's stairs. More details can be found in the club's <a href="https://stuyactivities.org/roadrunners/charter">charter</a>.
