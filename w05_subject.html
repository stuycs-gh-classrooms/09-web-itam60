    <h2>What is knitting?</h2>
    <p>
        Knitting is a method of creating fabric from fiber that has been practiced <a href="https://www.the-sustainable-fashion-collective.com/2017/05/04/knitting-brief-history-knitting-uses">for more than a millenium</a>. It involves 2 straight, pointed knitting needles. The fiber is wrapped around 1 needle, creating a row of loops, and the second needle is used to pull the fiber through each loop. The loops are essentially transferred from needle to needle, and the fabric grows longer with each row. There are only 2 basic stitches, which are the knit and purl. Any more complicated stitches are only combinations of these 2.

    <h2>What is crochet?</h2>

        Crochet is another method of creating fabric from fiber that has been practiced in its modern form <a href="https://littlejohnsyarn.com/who-invented-crochet-the-interesting-history-of-crochet/">since the 15th century</a>. It involves 1 hook. The fiber is used to create a single loop around the hook instead of a row of loops, and the head of the hook is used to pull fiber through the loop, forming a chain. The hook is then used to pull fiber through the links of the chain, creating a piece of fabric. There are many different stitches, such as the single crochet, double crochet, treble crochet, and popcorn stitch.

    <h2>Which is better?</h2>
    <p>
        Crochet and knitting create <a href="https://sarahmaker.com/knitting-vs-crochet/">very different pieces of fabric</a>. When using the same worsted weight yarn, knit fabric is more similar to mass-produced fabric: it is thin, stretchy, flat, and flexible. Meanwhile, crochet fabric made with that yarn is thick, less flexible, and bumpy, with larger gaps between the stitches. This makes knitting a better method for making larger garments like sweaters, while crochet is better for small items like amigurumi (small stuffed toys). However, there is significant overlap between these categories: for example, both methods can be used to make hats and scarves.
